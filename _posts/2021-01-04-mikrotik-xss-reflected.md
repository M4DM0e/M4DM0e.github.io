**Summary:** There is XSS-Reflected at the Mikrotik hotspot login page.

**Description:** In the hotspot login page there is hidden input called `target` with a blank value so you can add any value into it just by adding a new parameter with the value you want and it will be reflected in the page source
e.g: `c.net/login?target=HelloAll`

source code :
```html
<input type="text" name="target" value="HelloAll" />
```

but also there are no filters over there so, you can escape the input tag and start a new value e.g: `?target=hhh" onSubmit="alert(0)`

page source : 
```html
<input type="text" name="target" value="hhh" onSubmit="alert(0)" />
```
after the victim clicks on the submit button the XSS fires!

**How to exploit this?** 
Well, you have to be in the same network so you can play with this to get the admin user and password or cookies! also the users, with many techniques 

**PoC** 
There is a POC video that will share as soon as possible on my channel [GrodRiket Security](https://www.youtube.com/c/itgeeks)7
